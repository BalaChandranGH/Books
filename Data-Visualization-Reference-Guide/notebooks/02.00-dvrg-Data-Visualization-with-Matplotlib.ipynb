It starts an event loop, looks for all currently active figure objects, and opens one or more interactive windows that display the figure. The **`plt.show()`** command should be used only once per Python session. It should be used only at the end of the script. Multiple **`plt.show()`** commands can lead to unpredictable results and should mostly be avoided.\n",

    "**Plotting from an IPython shell:**<br>\n",
    "We can use Matplotlib interactively within the IPython shell. IPython works well with Matplotlib if we specify Matplotlib mode.

Any **`plt.plot`** command will cause a figure window to open and further commands can be run to update the plot.\n",
