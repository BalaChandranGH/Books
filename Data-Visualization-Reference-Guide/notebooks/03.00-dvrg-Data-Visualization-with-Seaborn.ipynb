The data is represented in rectangular bars where the length of the bar represents the proportion of the data in that category.

    "## 3.14. Linear relationships with Seaborn\n",
    "Many datasets contain multiple quantitative variables, and the goal of an analysis is often to relate those variables to each other. We can use statistical models to estimate a simple relationship between two sets of observations. These are termed, **regression models**. While building the regression models, we often check for multicollinearity, where we had to see the correlation between all the combinations of continuous variables and will take necessary action to remove multicollinearity if exists. There are two main functions in Seaborn to visualize a linear relationship determined through regression. These functions are:\n",
