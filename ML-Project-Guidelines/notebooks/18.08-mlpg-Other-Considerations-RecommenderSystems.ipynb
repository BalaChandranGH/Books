    "**Recommender System:**\n",
    "* A Recommender System is a process that seeks to predict user preferences\n",
    "* A recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item\n",
    "* Simply, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users\n",
    "* A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products that the users might be likely to buy\n",
    "* The most common type of predictive modeling\n",
    "* Recommendation systems are so powerful because they can propel revenue and profits for a company in which its users have to make **choices** and there are **a lot of options to choose from**\n",
    "* They provide the basis for recommendations on services such as Amazon, Spotify, YouTube, etc.\n",
    "* One can develop an effective recommender system using [matrix factorization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-to-matrix-decompositions-for-machine-learning/) methods ([SVD](https://machinelearningmastery.com/singular-value-decomposition-for-machine-learning/)) or even a straightforward k-nearest neighbors model by items or by users\n",
    "* Finding people with similar interests, analyze their behavior, and recommend to the new user the same items, or we can look at the items similar to ones which the user bought earlier, and recommend products that are like them\n",
    "* Recommendation problems can be `supervised` (classification) or `unsupervised` (clustering)\n",
    "* Some of the available algorithms: Collaborative Filtering (CF), clustering, and deep learning approaches \n",
    "* Evaluation metrics for recommendation engines are Recall, Precision, RMSE, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), MAP at K (Mean Average Precision at cutoff k), NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)"
