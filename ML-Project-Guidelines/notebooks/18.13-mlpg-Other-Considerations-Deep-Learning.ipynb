    "* DL is a subfield of ML concerned with algorithms inspired by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).\n",
    "* DL is a subset of ML where ANN (algorithms based on the structure and functioning of the human brain) learn from large amounts of data to create patterns for decision-making\n",
    "* Neural networks with various (deep) layers enable learning through performing tasks repeatedly and tweaking them a little to improve the outcome\n",
    "* Over the last few years, the availability of computing power and the amount of data being generated have led to an increase in deep learning capabilities<br>\n",
