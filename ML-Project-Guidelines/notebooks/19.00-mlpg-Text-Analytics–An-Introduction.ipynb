    "## 19.5. Differences between `Stemming` and `Lemmatization`\n",
    "* `Lemmatization` and `stemming` are special cases of **normalization** \n",
    "* They identify a canonical representative for a set of related word forms\n",
    "* `Lemmatization` is closely related to `stemming`, however, there are some differences\n",
    "* `Stemmer` operates on a single word **`without`** knowledge of the context\n",
    "* `Stemmer` cannot discriminate between words that have different meanings depending on the POS \n",
    "* Stemmers are typically easier to implement and run faster\n",
    "* When used within information retrieval systems, `stemming improves` query **`recall accuracy`**, or **`true positive rate`**, when compared to `lemmatization`, nonetheless, `stemming reduces` **`precision`**, or **`true negative rate`**, for such systems, for instance:\n",
    "  - The word \"better\" has \"good\" as its lemma. This link is missed by stemming, as it requires a dictionary look-up\n",
    "  - The word \"walk\" is the base form for the word \"walking\", and hence this is matched in both stemming and lemmatization\n",
    "  - The word \"meeting\" can be either the base form of a noun or a form of a verb (\"to meet\") depending on the context; e.g., \"in our last meeting\" or \"We are meeting again tomorrow\". Unlike stemming, lemmatization attempts to select the correct lemma depending on the context\n",
    "* A `stemmer` will return the stem of a word, which needn't be identical to the morphological root of the word. It is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if the stem is not in itself a valid root, while in `lemmatization`, it will return the dictionary form of a word, which must be valid\n",
    "* In `lemmatization`, the part of speech of a word should be first determined and the normalization rules will be different for a different part of speech, while the `stemmer` operates on a single word without knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech\n",
    "* An example-driven explanation of the differences between lemmatization and stemming:\n",
    "  - `Lemmatization` handles matching ‚Äú**car**‚Äù to ‚Äú**cars**‚Äù along with matching ‚Äú**car**‚Äù to ‚Äú**automobile**‚Äù\n",
    "  - `Stemming` handles matching ‚Äú**car**‚Äù to ‚Äú**cars**‚Äù only\n",
    "* `Stemming` just removes or stems the last few characters of a word, often leading to incorrect meanings and spelling. `Lemmatization` considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form, which is called Lemma. Sometimes, the same word can have multiple different Lemmas. We should identify the Part of Speech (POS) tag for the word in that specific context. Here are the examples to illustrate all the differences and use cases:\n",
    "  - If you `lemmatize` the word '**Caring**', it would return '**Care**'. If you `stem`, it would return '**Car**' and this is erroneous\n",
    "  - If you `lemmatize` the word '**Stripes**' in `verb context`, it would return '**Strip**'. If you `lemmatize` it in `noun context`, it would return '**Stripe**'. If you just `stem` it, it would just return '**Strip**'\n",
    "  - You would get the same results whether you `lemmatize or stem` words such as **walking**, **running**, **swimming**... to **walk**, **run**, **swim**, etc.\n",
    "  - `Lemmatization` is _**computationally expensive**_ since it involves look-up tables and whatnot. \n",
    "    - If you have a `large dataset and performance is an issue`, go with **`Stemming`**. You can also add your rules to Stemming. \n",
    "    - If `accuracy is paramount and the dataset isn't humongous`, go with **`Lemmatization`**"
