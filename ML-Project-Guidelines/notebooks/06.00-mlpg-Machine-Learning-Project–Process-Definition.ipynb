    "## 6.1. Machine Learning projects vs Data Science projects\n",
    "ML projects are part of DS projects; however, all data science projects need not use ML. The usage of ML in DS projects depends on the volume and the complexity of the data, and the type of problem it’s trying to solve. Most of today’s DS projects use ML to find answers to problems. In this section, it’s assumed that ML projects are part of DS projects and are not delivered as stand-alone projects. The ML team does not involve fully in all the stages of DSPM. ML projects center around EDA, data preprocessing, and modeling only while they are partially involved in other stages as well. It should be noted that if the ML team is expected to involve in all the stages of the DS project, then it becomes a DS project! With this in mind, a guideline has been given below on various stages of an ML project."

    "## 6.2. Role Definitions\n",
    "The roles mentioned in the “Machine Learning Project - Process Definition” and “Machine Learning Project – Stages” sections are indicative only. Depending on the size and the complexity of the projects, additional roles can be defined such as Data Architect, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Business User, Project Lead, etc. If the size of the project/organization is small or the complexity is low, then the Data Scientist may play the unicorn role with the combined roles of ML Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Architect, Data Analyst, Project Manager, Project Lead & Solution Architect. Given below are the role definitions for a small to intermediate project size/complexity."
