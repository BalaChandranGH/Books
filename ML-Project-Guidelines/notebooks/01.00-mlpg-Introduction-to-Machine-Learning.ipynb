    "* In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict/estimate\n",

    "* While ML has made tremendous progress in the last few years, some big challenges still need to be solved\n",
    "* It is an area of active research and you can expect a lot of effort to solve these problems in the coming time. The challenges are:\n",
    "  - _**Huge data requirement**_: It takes a huge amount of data to train a model today. For example – if you want to classify Cats vs. Dogs based on images (and you don’t use an existing model) – you would need the model to be trained on thousands of images. Compare that to a human – we typically explain the difference between Cat and Dog to a child by using 2 or 3 photos\n",
    "  - _**High computing requirement**_: As of now, machine learning and deep learning models require huge computations to achieve simple tasks (simple according to humans). This is why the use of special hardware including GPUs and TPUs is required. The cost of computations needs to come down for machine learning to make a next-level impact\n",
    "  - _**Interpretation of models is difficult at times**_: Some modeling techniques can give us high accuracy but are difficult to explain. This can leave the business owners frustrated. Imagine being a bank, but you cannot tell why you declined a loan for a customer!\n",
    "  - _**New and better algorithms requirement**_: Researchers are consistently looking out for new and better algorithms to address some of the problems mentioned above\n",
    "  - _**Need for more Data Scientists**_: Further, since the domain has grown so quickly – there aren’t many people with the skill sets required to solve the vast variety of problems. This is expected to remain so for the next few years. So, if you are thinking about building a career in machine learning – you are in good stead!"
