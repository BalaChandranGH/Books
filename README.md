## Machine Learning Project Guidelines - For Beginners
This book can be used as a guideline (or) a reference (or) an aid to develop and deliver ML projects. 
This book talks about only very few commonly used ML algorithms. Several ML algorithms are already available and several others are being developed and published from time to time as well that are outside the scope of this book. 

Additionally, this book covers Supervised Learning (Regression and Classification problems) and Unsupervised Learning (Clustering problems) only. The guidelines discussed in this book are suitable for any ML enthusiast from beginner to intermediate. 

This book starts with an introduction to ML, a grouping of ML algorithms, the pros and cons of ML algorithms, and the types of ML algorithms. Then, it covers in detail the process definition and the different stages in an ML project. It also provides a brief introduction to text analytics and social network analysis. Finally, it concludes with 3 case studies.

## Data Visualization Reference Guide - For Beginners
This book can be used as a reference guide for Visualization, especially in Python programming.

Though there are several tools available for visualizations in practice, this book talks about only very few commonly used visualizations. Additionally, many visualizations libraries are being developed and published from time to time as well that are outside the scope of this reference guide.

This reference guide is suitable for any beginner who is interested to learn Visualization in Python.
